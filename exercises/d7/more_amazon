Building off your amazon app from last time, go through our design process

What routes (i.e. urls) make sense for interacting with your application for the actions you listed in Step 3 in 6B exercise 2? Let's call these our activities.
What controller should each route go to? Does the activity always correlate nicely with a resource? If so, which one? If not, why not?
What action in each controller should each activity go to? Is it something that shows a list of instances (index), shows a particular one (show), creates one (create), updates one (update) or deletes one (delete)?
Draw a full map url -> controller -> action for each activity.

	users/edit/id, to edit username and password --> UserController --> update
	users/edit/settings, to edit Settings --> UserController --> update

	ShoppingCart/add, add item --> ShoppingCartController -->  create
	ShoppingCart/delete, deletes item --> ShoppingCartController --> delete

	items/price, displays price of item --> ItemController --> show
	items/stock_quantity, shows amount of item left --> ItemController --> show
