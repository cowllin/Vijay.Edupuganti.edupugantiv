Again, we went over a lot of methods! Make sure you understand what each one returns, and whether they are a class or instance method. Look them up if you forgot—thankfully, Rails has really good documentation with APIDock.

.all --> returns all matching records
.first --> returns first matching record
.new --> new object to be instantiated or set to certain conditions
.find --> returns records that satisfy condition, returns single model object
.find_by --> finds first record matching condition
.where --> returns records that satisfy condition in argument, returns ActiveRecord relation (collection of model objects)
.save --> saves the model
.update_attributes --> updates attributes from argument and saves record
.destroy --> destroys object w/ given ID
What's the difference between .find and .find_by? one finds record by id, the other finds the first record that matches the condition

Fire up rails console from within your 'twitter' rails app folder from class today. Then do the following things. After you're confident in your code, write the commands you wrote for each step in d7/activerecord_commands:

Create a User with a name and followers count
	new_user = User.new
	new_user.name = "Vijay"
	new_user.followers = 1000
Find it with User.find. Assign the result to the variable user
	User.find(5) # index of user
	user = User.find(5)
Find it by name with User.find_by
	User.find_by(name = "Vijay")
Write a command that finds all the users with followers count equal to 10.
	User.find_by(followers = 10)
Update user from step 2 to have a different name. Make sure to save!
	user.name = "VJ"
	user.save
Create a Tweet for this user. Assign the correct user_id, and make sure to save.
	tweet = Tweet.new
	tweet.user_id = 5
Update the tweet from step 6 to have a different body.
	tweet.body = "Hey man"
Destroy it.
	tweet.destroy


A bit harder now:

Create 10 users programmatically, each with a different name. Use a loop—you might want to write pseudo-code first!
i = 0
while (i < 10)
	new_user = User.new
	new_user.name = "VJ" + i_to_s
	new_user.save
	i = i + 1
end 

Destroy them all
i = 4 # Starting index of all newly created users
while (i < 14)
	User.find(i).destroy
	i = i + 1
end

Create 10 tweets in a similar way.
i = 0
while (i < 10)
	new_tweet = Tweet.new
	new_tweet.save
	i = i + 1
end 

Update all of them to have the body "Ruby is fat"
i = 6 #Starting index of all newly created tweets from previous steps
while (i < 16)
	Tweet.find(i).body == "Ruby is fat"
	i = i + 1
end


Update the fourth one to say "Ruby is getting even fatter"
Tweet.find(10).body == "Ruby is getting even fatter"
