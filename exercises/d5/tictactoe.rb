# How will you keep track of whose turn it is?
	# Turns should alternate between Player 1 and Player 2. Put in a loop,
	# w/ check condition to determine if someone one
# What data structure will you use to keep track of the board? You only
#   know two (Array, Hash), but remember they can be nested (meaning an
#   array can contain another arrayâ€”it can even contain a hash that contains
#   another hash, though unclear if that will be useful :P)
# 	Array w/ nested hash. Or double array (2D array)
# When a player makes a move, what should happen?
	# Board should be updated, data structure updated, check if someone won
# How do you keep track of which squares have Xs and which have Os?
	# Store in data structure
# How do you detect a winner?
	# Determine if three in a row.
# When does the program stop? Is there a loop? If so, what kind?
# When someone wins, loop between player 1 and player 2 turns

#TO DO:
#Address invalid moves, must repeat turn not go to next person
